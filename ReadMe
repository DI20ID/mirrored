At its core this program is an irc client. It connects to twitch and reads the chat of the specified twitch channel.
If a user in chat uses the !xsay command the programm checks with the aquired soldier list if the twitchuser is "present in game".
For this to work the twitchuser needs to have the  !!!same!!!  dispayname as the soldiers last name.

If you use the programm for the first time the executable will generate a config file. Here it will save username, channel and
the authentication key you use (if you klick the "get password link" in the GUI and you are logged into twitch in your standard browser
the key will be generated for that logged in twitch user).
Furthermore it will generate a "sTimedelaybetweenmessages" key (value in ms; standard value of 30000) which controlls the amount of time a twitch chat
user has to wait between messages. (twitch chat users will not get feedback if they message to often, the
                                      message just wont trigger a flyover message)

How to:
install the XCOM 2 Mod - TwitchSoldierMessages 
      copie all files into your XCOM2 mod directory - \\steamapps\common\XCOM 2\XComGame\Mods\TwitchSoldierMessages
start the programm
when you are in a tactical mission in XCOM2 press die "GetSoldierNames" button
      -now a list of your soldiers will pop up at the bottom of the programm
press the "Connect" button - the status bar should change from "Disconnected" to "Connected"

enjoy





PS: there is a lot of unused code in there for chat and led control over network - figure it out if you need it
